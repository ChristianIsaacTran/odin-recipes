# odin-recipes
This is the 1st project that uses everything I've learned in the HTML section of the odin project
to construct a basic 3 webpage site that has food recipes, complete with images and directions.
When I learn CSS, I can edit this page to style it to my specifications. I used these concepts when creating
this website and publishing it on github publically:
-Git and github basics:
    -The 3 step process when committing
    -Making good commit comments
-HTML basics:
    <h1></h1> = header tags (1 through 6)
    <p></p> = paragraph tags 
    <strong></strong> = bold text, adds significance to bold text
    <em></em> = italicized text, adds emphasis to the italisized text
    -The HTML boilerplate with metadata and !DOCTYPE html
    <a href="" target="" rel=""> </a> = anchor tag, href creates it a link to other things
    <img src="" alt=""> = image tag (void tag so no closing tag), with source of images
-Also learned how to publish public websites through github
-Finished this project 12/22/2024
